## Introduction

In this project, you will create a simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code. 

You will get a general idea of static code analysis and expand your competence in Python.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:
1. Search for long lines. Write a program that performs a simple code style check and finds lines that are too long.
2. New checks. Add checks for proper use of indentation, semicolons, spaces before comments, TODOs, and blank lines.
3. Analyze multi-file projects. Learn how to work with multiple files and directories and process command-line arguments.
4. Check names according to PEP8. Use regular expressions to check proper naming.
5. Analyze arguments and variables. Use the Abstract Syntax Tree to polish your program. Your own tool for analyzing code style issues is ready to use!

Other features will be coming soon!
